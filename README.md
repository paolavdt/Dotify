# Dotify HW5 - WorkManager & Notifications
Name: Paola Vanegas

## Description
Dotify currently contains three main activities: a list of available songs, a song player with information about the current song, and setttings. The list of songs (containing titlee, artist, and album cover) is fetched from the musiclibrary.json. The song player will increase the number of song play counts when play button is cliked, and change songs based on skip/previous song controls. Within settings, there are four options: profile, about, statistics, and auto refresh. Profile displays an image and some information about a user. About displays information about me. Statistics displays an the album cover image of the selected song, the number of times it has been played, song duratio, and total listening time of the current song. Auto refresh will send a notification every 20 minutes with a random song 'added to Dotify' and call a new fetch request. 

## Extra Credit Attempted
- Was going to display song from notification to activity player but no longer...sorry
